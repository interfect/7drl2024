# False Ghost
A [7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2024](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2024) game.

Are you ready to take on enemies embodyng the power of **Fire**?
The fury of **Air**?
The tedium of **Business**?

Then you're ready to play *False Ghost*.

I saw a (possibly aprcryphal) list of 7DRL game requirements that said that a game needed a minimal number of enemy types to participate.
So I made this.
This game has no enemy types, item types, or obstacle types in it.
It invents them all on the spot.
(Note that this makes it take a while to load.)
