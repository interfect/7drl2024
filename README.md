# False Ghost
A [7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2024](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2024) game.

Are you ready to take on enemies embodyng the power of **Fire**?
The fury of **Air**?
The tedium of **Business**?

Then you're ready to play *False Ghost*.

I saw a (possibly aprcryphal) list of 7DRL game requirements that said that a game needed a minimal number of enemy types to participate.
So I made this.
This game has no enemy types, item types, or obstacle types in it.
It invents them all on the spot.
(Note that this makes it take a while to load.)

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.

2. Wait for it to download the 4 gigabyte model file.

3. Wait for it to generate the first level.
This will take a while!

4. Note the kind of vibes you get when you enter a level.
Most of the enemies will be of this elemental domain.

5. Run around the dungeon bumping into things, with `WASD` or your favorite movement keys.

6. Bump into enemies to attack them!
They conveniently hold still.

7. When you kill an enemy, you will get an item.
Rarer enemies drop rarer (better) items.

8. Use `Q` and `E` to cycle through your items.
Try to make sure you have an item equipped when attacking an enemy, because attacking unarmed is less effective.
Rarer items do more damage.
If you equip an item of the elemental domain that beats your enemy's, you will do more damage and take less!

9. Fence an item for cash with `F`.
The more cash you have when you die, the better!
